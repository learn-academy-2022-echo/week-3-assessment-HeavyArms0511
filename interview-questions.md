# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Notes:  After doing these questions I realize I need to study the vocabulary more and have a deeper understanding of it



Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

Your answer: JSX is a way for us to use javascript inside of react.  JSX and HTML are similar but I believe they are different because you use jsx in react to communicate javascript functions and abilities with it.

Researched answer: So after some research JSX is a syntax extension that works really well with react. JSX stands for Javascript XML. It helps us write HTML elements inside of react and lets us have the ability to have more freedom and ways to approach things by using JSX.

2. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run yarn?

Your answer: Yarn is a library on the internet that holds alot of dependencies that we use in react and to do TDD.  It adds the node module files into react when we run yarn

Researched answer: Yarn is a packet manager for javascript. Yarn actually stands for Yet Another Resource Negotiator which was actually created by facebook for them to use.  Yarn is a way for all these files and dependencies to live on the internet and for us to actually access them when we not and not keep all the files on our own local machine.  

3. What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

Your answer: An anonymous function is a function that does not have to be declared and named and is used inside other functions.

Researched answer:An anonymous function is a function that is not declared or identified with a specific name. They are normally passed as arguents in higher-order functions.

4. What is the difference between a class and an object?

Your answer: A class is a container that holds alot of objects and an object can not contain a class.  A class is a way to hold multiple objects.

Researched answer: A class is essentially the blueprint for an object while an object is an instance of a class. A class is what helps defines the objects and their behavoir. In lamens terms the object is the physical part of it while the class is the logical part. 

5. What is the difference between state and props in React?

Your answer: State is what is happening at the given moment whether its an array of variables the state is that set array.  While props are a way to access the state and even change and mutate it.

Researched answer: State is a storage in react where it can hold data while props are used to pass data to other components and throughout react.  State is also only located in the one component and can not be passed through other components and thats what props are used for to help pass the information.

6. STRETCH: Which is the difference between a div and a span?

Your answer: Div is a way to section off content and put things in its own container and I believe span is a another way to store things and essentially the same thing

Researched answer:  Span and div takes things and groups them together in like their own little container. A div is used for block-level organization and where a span  is used for inline organization. Like a box inside of the box.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Object-oriented programming: Object Oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects. It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes), which are used to create individual instances of objects.

(I did copy paste per it being ok with Austin :D)

2. Ruby: Ruby is an open-source object-oriented scripting language invented in the mid-90s by Yukihiro Matsumoto.

3. Implicit return: A function is returned values without using the return keyword, it's called an implicit return. 

4. Ruby blocks: Ruby code blocks are called closures in other programming languages. It consist of a group of codes which is always enclosed with braces or written between do..end. The braces syntax always have the higher precedence over the do..end syntax. Braces have high precedence and do has low precedence.

5. Ruby hashes: A Ruby hash is a collection of unique keys and their values. They are similar to arrays but array use integer as an index and hash use any object type. They are also called associative arrays, dictionaries or maps.
